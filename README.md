A first draft of the class was produced by Corey Stambaugh (corey.stambaugh @ nist.gov) more or less 09/12/2018.
The class was written to mimic the template style of the ACTA IMEKO journal
https://acta.imeko.org/ which is written as a .doc file by: Thomas Bruns, Dirk RÃ¶ske, Paul P. L. Regtien, Francisco Alegria

This class file was originally downloaded as SelfArx.cls.
